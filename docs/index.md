# Welcome to My Research Page

My name is Amelia Greathouse and I am currently pursuing my Master's Degree at Mcgill University.

I don't have a professional headshot yet, so meet Enzo.

I am focused on the exploration of [Ultracold Neutrons](https://lansce.lanl.gov/facilities/ultracold-neutrons/index.php), whose beta decay asymmetry is a fascinating area of study. This platform serves as an invitation to accompany me on a scholarly journey into the depths of some of the universe's smallest particles. Through meticulous experimentation, I aim to help determine the fundemantal qualities of Ultracold Neutrons, ultimately contributing to a broader understanding of the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model). I extend a formal welcome to all who wish to engage with the frontiers of nuclear physics through the lens of my ongoing research endeavors.

If you're like to learn more about me, you can find an introduction to [my research](./research/index.md), some info on some [recent projects](./projects/index.md) and some more info [about me](./about/index.md).
