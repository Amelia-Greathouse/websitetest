# Introduction

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Physics at East Tennessee State University, publishing an undergraduate thesis about my contributions to the UCNA+ Project. Pursuing a Masters Degree at Mcgill in physics aligns seamlessly with my aspiration to contribute meaningfully to both laboratory research and the dynamic landscape of industrial applications. My research interests lie in the captivating realm of hands-on, experimental nuclear and particle physics, where I can delve into the fundamental aspects of the universe through immersive exploration and observation.

My goals for grad school are to aim for academic excellence while delving into impactful research, ultimately striving for publication and a meaningful career. I would like to foster a robust network by connecting with professors, peers, and professionals. I strive to prioritize growth by developing a versatile skill set, nurturing a balanced life, and aligning my experiences with future career aspirations. In the long term, my aspiration is to contribute to the field of physics either within an industry setting or in a laboratory environment.

# Other Interests

In my fleeting moments of spare time outside of my studies, I enjoy a few hobbies such as crocheting, reading, and playing the tuba. A few of my all time favorite books are "The Bell Jar" by Silvia Plath and the entirety of the Percy Jackson series by Rick Riordan.
